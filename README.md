CSS DePaul Web Development
==========================

The CSS DePaul Web Development Project is underway, by the time it's done CSS will have a website to show of the fruits of its labor.

Currently, we are getting the members of our team up to speed on basic web development technologies.

## TODO List

1. Have everyone learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP
2. Hold *awesome* website design contest
3. Get winning design up and running so that everyone can see how cool CSS is

## Potential Features

Here are some ideas of things to include in your site for the contest, and things that can be added once we get the server live.

- Embedded Twitter Feed (bonus points if you use the Twitter api to grab tweets rather than using an embed)
- Login system for registering members (bonus points if you implement SQRL alongide username/password login)
- List of past and current members, and which projects they were involved in (bonus points if you can find a way to show a list of their contributions on GitHub)
